# Research computing sustainability at Exeter

## Why, as researchers, do we need to think about environmental sustainability?

The analysis of large and complex datasets requires the use of large-scale computational resources. Data centres, high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, and individual workstations in computational research all demand substantial energy consumption and resources. Consequently, computational research activities contribute significantly to our overall environmental impact.

Additionally to the electricity used and the indirect emissions from this, computational research impacts the environment through so-called "embodied carbon emissions" which occur from the manufacturing, shipping and disposal of the hardware used. 

Many researchers are increasingly interested in how to reduce the environmental impacts of their computational research, and some funders, such as the [Wellcome Trust] (https://wellcome.org/research-funding/guidance/policies-grant-conditions/environmental-sustainability-funding-policy), require grant recipients to state how they will assess and tackle these impacts.

## How, as researchers, can we reduce our carbon footprint?

Computational researchers often don't have control over the supply chain of the hardware they use or the electricity sources used to power their research computing. However, there are things all researchers can consider to reduce the emissions associated with their research.

The [Green Software Foundation](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/) defines three "Green Software Principles" that can reduce the carbon emissions of software:

- **Energy efficiency**: Consume the least amount of electricity possible, for example making sure we are using the most up-to-date versions of software tools as these are often more efficient than older versions.

- **Hardware efficiency**: Use the least amount of embodied carbon possible by making the most use out of existing hardware and correctly recycling hardware that can no longer be used.

- **Carbon awareness**: Do more when electricity supplies are coming from renewable sources, and less at times when electricity is generated from carbon-intensive sources for example by using carbon-aware job-scheduling to schedule computationally intensive tasks to run at times when carbon intensity of the national grid is lower.

## Green DiSC

Various research groups at Exeter are taking part in [Green DiSC](https://www.software.ac.uk/GreenDiSC), a certification scheme which looks to provide research groups and institutions with practical guidelines for how to address the environmental impact of their computing activities.

The scheme provides a roadmap for sustainable computational research, with different levels of certification (Bronze, Silver, and Gold) that groups can work towards. The criteria are focused on practical, evidence-based actions, based on Green Software and FAIR principles, that can reduce the environmental footprint of research computing.

The sustainable labs team has setup a Central team that is currently in the processes of applying for Bronze and have curated key information relating to IT infrstructure and sustainable computing practices at the University as a whole which can be useful in any research group submission.

If you are interested in applying as a research group or to find out more, please e-mail [Amy Cotton](A.Cotton@exeter.ac.uk) (Technical Manager of the Lab Sustainability group at the University and GreenDiSC central group representative) and enrol [here](https://forms.gle/PBruBq5Z7xNT665C8).
